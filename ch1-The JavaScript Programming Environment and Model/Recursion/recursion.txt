When a function is called recursively, the results of the function’s computation are tem‐
porarily suspended while the recursion is in progress. To demonstrate how this works,
here is a diagram for the factorial() function when the argument passed to the func‐
tion is 5:
5 * factorial(4)
5 * 4 * factorial(3)
5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
5 * 4 * 3 * 2
5 * 4 * 6
5 * 24
